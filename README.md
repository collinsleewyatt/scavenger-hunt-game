# scavenger-hunt-game
Built on Firebase. Users scanned QR codes which linked to the website with a code on it. The software would track how many they had, and if they had twelve, they would be able to select a prize. I printed out pumpkins with the QR codes on them and hid them in my building.

The deployment is live here, but I removed the ability to log in: https://pumpkin-accbc.web.app
