# A warning: only demons lie here
This contains a LOT of spaghetti code, callback hell, repetition, etc. I wanted to get this out quick and make it functional so I could do the event, but clearly did not care about making it pretty! I think for personal projects like this which had an expiration date (this game lasted about a month before I deleted all the data), it was ok to make it messy in the interest of getting it out on time.

I'm also using JQuery as a framework instead of something like React, which I wasn't too familiar with at the time, but it would have helped me a lot. This code has a lot of reactive elements (changing the text upon login, saying how many more need to be found, error messages) which would have benefitted from React.
